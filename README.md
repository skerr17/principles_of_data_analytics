# Principles of Data Analytics Project: Iris Dataset

By Stephen Kerr

## Purpose of this Repository 
This Repository contains my sumission for the assessments for the Module Principles of Data Analytics for my HDIP in Computing and Data Analytics. 

The purpose of this assessment is to allow me to demonstrate my achievement of the module learning outcomes.  

The aim of the **Principles of Data Analytics** module is to enable students to demonstrate their ability to:
>1. Source and investigate sets of data.
>2. Programmatically explore and visualize data.
>3. Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
>4. Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
>5. Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
>6. Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

See the documentation [here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/principles_of_data_analytics/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#principles-of-data-analytics).   
The Lecturer for this Module is Ian McLogughlin (email: ian.mcloughlin@atu.ie)
